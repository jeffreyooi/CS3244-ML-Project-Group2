# CS3244 ML Project Group2

## Project Description
The goal is to train a model to determine if a tumor in breast has a high probability that it is benign or malignant. Our image data and labels are retrieved from CBIS-DDSM: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CBIS-DDSM#23898f1e0bc04705a6b07f75962dc3de

## Technique
We use a machine learning technique called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train our model.

## About us
We are a team of 6 students from NUS who hopes to be able to use ML to make the world a better place.
